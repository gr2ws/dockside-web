      <h2 class = "pt-2">Collection of Personal Data</h2>
      <p class = " py-3 lh-lg">
        We collect personal information to provide better service to our guests. 
        This happens when you book a room, check in, request services, 
        or engage with us online. We may also collect information when you subscribe to our
        updates, join loyalty programs, or participate in surveys. The personal data we collect 
        typically includes your name, contact details, government-issued ID (only upon check-in), 
        payment information, and occasionally, travel plans or special requests like dietary needs. 
        We only collect what's necessary for us to serve you well.
      </p>
    
      <h2 class = "pt-2">How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p class = "py-3 lh-lg">
        We use the data you provide to process reservations, manage your stay, respond to your
        inquiries, and handle payments. It also helps us personalize your experience and send
        you relevant newsletters or promotions—if you've opted in. Additionally, we may use your 
        information to comply with legal obligations.
      </p>
    
      <h2 class = "pt-2">Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p class = "py-3 lh-lg">
        Luxury Hotel <strong>does not and will not</strong> sell your personal information. However, 
        we may share (limited) data with service providers who help us run our business: payment processors,
        transportation providers, and legal advisors. We also comply with government or legal 
        requests when required. Everyone we work with is expected to keep your data secure and 
        confidential.
      </p>
    
      <h2 class = "pt-2">Data Storage and Retention</h2>
      <p class = "py-3 lh-lg">
        Your data is stored securely using technical and organizational safeguards. 
        We keep it only for as long as it is needed—for example, to fulfill a booking or to
        meet legal requirements. When the data is no longer needed, we delete or anonymize it 
        in a secure way.
      </p>
    
      <h2 class = "pt-2">Data Protection and Security</h2>
      <p class = "py-3 lh-lg">
        We take your privacy seriously. Our systems include protections like secure networks 
        and login portals, and limited access to sensitive data. Staff are trained to handle 
        personal information responsibly. While no system is 100% perfect, we work hard to keep 
        your data safe.
